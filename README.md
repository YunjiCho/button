# Skeuomorphic Buttons (Realistic 3D effect)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jouanmarcel/pen/RwweKqb](https://codepen.io/jouanmarcel/pen/RwweKqb).

Skeuomorphism was used on the earlier iPhones and was made popular by it as well for UI design. It got mostly deprecated by flat design, as skeuomorphic elements are harder to create, maintain and scale across different platforms. You will notice, that the style doesn't work out nicely when you change a single color like the background. Play with it, learn what happens and how it is done, but I would not recommend to use it on your website / app. It's 2020 anyway and skeuomorphism is still out, otherwise you should at least wait a couple of years til it's considered vintage, retro and trendy again üíÅ
